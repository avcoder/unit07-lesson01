# Types of Deployment use-cases:

- Personal deployment: e.g., running code locally using localhost.
- Small applications: deploying to services like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.
- Enterprise deployment: CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Open-source applications: community-driven deployment, contributor coordination.

# Standard Web Deployment Process

- Local: Developer‚Äôs personal machine.
- Development: Internal environment for developers to share/test.
- Staging: Mirrors production, for final tests and approvals.
- Live (Production): Public-facing, used by end users.

## Deployment variations
- Some teams skip staging.
- Use of feature flags or canary releases.
- Continuous Deployment vs Manual Deployment.

# Processes Involved in Web Deployment

- Testing #1: to ensure the application works locally before going live
   - Unit testing, Integration testing, End-to-End testing, Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Testing #2: to ensure application still works in staging (just before it gets deployed to prod)
  - Watch me [test on staging](https://www.loom.com/share/d3b4d1c3c7f64ffebeee0a6a9dfc5cc7?sid=2329b9da-90bb-4901-a41d-4d348179e26f) for my former workplace 
- Testing #3: Once deployed, test one more time to make sure everything looks/functions correctly
- Monitoring:
  - Tools like Sentry can capture runtime errors and log them
  - DevOps team can monitor real-time server health and performance, as well as rollback if needed

# Exercise
5 min

1. Use [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to draw a simple diagram of the architecture of our Express/MongoDB/EJS app
2. Now draw a 2nd diagram of the architecture of an Express (JSON API)/MongoDB/React app
3. Once done, click "Share" > Export to Link > Copy link, then paste it in chat

# Architecture

- Right now, all of this runs on your computer, but how do we make this available to the world?
  - Each piece (frontend, backend, DB) needs to live somewhere online (ex: Netlify, Render, MongoDB Atlas)
- Examine the Fetch/XHR requests on Network tab for app.agencyanalytics.com - where does it go?
- Exercise: Draw a diagram on excalidraw showing how the app is architected
- How can your Express backend and React Frontend be deployed in similar fashion?

# Architecture: Monolithic vs Microservice vs. Other

- Monolithic App: One codebase that contains everything: frontend, backend, and logic together.
  - ex: The Note-taking app you built
- Microservices: Different services doing different tasks, each deployable separately.
  - ex: One service for user auth, another for task management, another for notifications.
- Other: Somewhere in between where it's modular or decoupled

| Feature    | Monolith   | Microservices              |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Codebase   | Single     | Multiple                   |
| Deployment | One deploy | Many deploys               |
| Scaling    | Harder     | Easier (scale per service) |
| Good for   | Small apps | Large apps with teams      |

# What kind of architecture might the following be?

- front-end React code stored in one Github repo, perhaps hosted on Netlify/Vercel
- back-end Node/Express JSON APIs stored on another Github repo, perhaps hosted on render
- Mongo DB hosted on cloud (Atlas) 

| Feature    | Architecture   | 
| ---------- | ---------- | 
| Frontend & backend separated?   | ‚úÖ Yes     | 
| Independent deployment? | ‚úÖ Yes | 
| Multiple microservices?    | ‚ùå No (single backend)     | 
| Shared DB?  | ‚úÖ MongoDB Atlas | 
| Monolithic? | ‚ùå No |
| Microservices? | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not quite |

# Architecture: Modular or Decoupled

- Previous slide described what might be called Decoupled / Modular Architecture
- Since frontend and backend are separated into different services and repositories, this is already one major step away from a monolith
- This modularity allows independent deployment and scaling of frontend / backend
- It also borrows some microservices principles:
   - independent deployment pipelines
   - separation of concerns
   - individual hosting environments

| **Environment Variables**        | - `.env` files<br>- Keeping secrets out of source code|
