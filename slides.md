# Types of Deployment use-cases:

- Personal deployment: e.g., running code locally using localhost.
- Small applications: deploying to services like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.
- Enterprise deployment: CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Open-source applications: community-driven deployment, contributor coordination.

# Standard Web Deployment Process

- Local: Developer‚Äôs personal machine.
- Development: Internal environment for developers to share/test.
- Staging: Mirrors production, for final tests and approvals.
- Live (Production): Public-facing, used by end users.

## Deployment variations
- Some teams skip staging.
- Use of feature flags or canary releases.
- Continuous Deployment vs Manual Deployment.

# Processes Involved in Web Deployment

- Testing #1: to ensure the application works locally before going live
   - Unit testing, Integration testing, End-to-End testing, Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Testing #2: to ensure application still works in staging (just before it gets deployed to prod)
  - Watch me [test on staging](https://www.loom.com/share/d3b4d1c3c7f64ffebeee0a6a9dfc5cc7?sid=2329b9da-90bb-4901-a41d-4d348179e26f) for my former workplace 
- Testing #3: Once deployed, test one more time to make sure everything looks/functions correctly
- Monitoring:
  - Tools like Sentry can capture runtime errors and log them
  - DevOps team can monitor real-time server health and performance, as well as rollback if needed

# Architecture

- Exercise: Draw a diagram on excalidraw showing how your local Express/React app is architected
- Examine the Fetch/XHR requests on Network tab for app.agencyanalytics.com - where does it go?
- Exercise: Draw a diagram on excalidraw showing how the app is architected
- How can your Express backend and React Frontend be deployed in similar fashion?
